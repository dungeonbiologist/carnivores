Laying down 4 hexes on a radius 4 board. Repeat 10 million times.
Radius 4 means you can go 3 hexes away from the center.

- Set out a hexagonal grid of "radius" 3 (i.e., from the center tile, you can go three tiles in any of the 6 directions)
- Pick four of those tiles at random (without replacement)
- Separate the tiles into contiguous groups
- Evaluate the size and moment of inertia of each group
